*Text Editor in Java - Advanced Level*

This Java project is an advanced text editor application that provides a comprehensive set of features to create, edit, store, and print
text documents. The editor utilizes Java Swing components such as JTextArea, JMenu, JMenuItems, and JMenuBar to provide a user-friendly 
graphical user interface (GUI) for performing various text-related tasks.

*Key Features:*
1. *Graphical User Interface (GUI):* The text editor offers a user-friendly GUI, allowing users to interact with the application easily.
The main text editing area is represented by a JTextArea, where users can enter and manipulate text.

2. *File Menu:* The file menu contains options to open existing text files, save the edited content, close the current file, and print the
document for future reference.

4. *Save Button :* The text editor includes a "Save" button, which allows users to save the changes made to the file and close it after 
saving the data.

5. *ActionListener:* The project utilizes ActionListener to detect user actions within the text editor. It helps in capturing events like
button clicks, menu selections, and other user interactions.

*Functionality:*
1. When the text editor is launched, the GUI displays an empty JTextArea where users can enter and edit text.

2. Users can use the file menu to open existing text files, save the edited content to the file, close the current file, or print the
document for future reference.

3. The edit menu allows users to cut, copy, and paste selected text within the JTextArea, providing basic text manipulation capabilities.

4. After making changes to the content, users can use the "Save" button to save the data to the file and close the file.

*Code Description:*
This advanced text editor is implemented in Java using Swing components to provide an intuitive and feature-rich user interface. JTextArea
is used as the main text editing component, while JMenu, JMenuItems, and JMenuBar are used to create the file and edit menus with their 
respective options.

ActionListener is used to detect user actions, enabling the application to respond to button clicks and menu selections effectively.
The code ensures proper handling of file operations, allowing users to open, save, and close files, as well as cut, copy, and paste text 
within the text editor.
