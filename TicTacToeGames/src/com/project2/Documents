*Tic-Tac-Toe Game - Beginner Level*

This Java project is a classic implementation of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed for beginners. The game allows two players to take
turns playing on a 3x3 board, aiming to create a line of their chosen symbol (X or O) either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The first player to achieve this line wins the game, and the game ends in a draw if all the board positions are filled without a winner.

*Game Rules:*
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 board displayed on the screen, and two players are prompted to take turns.

2. Player 1, also known as "X," makes the first move by entering their symbol (X) into an empty box of their choice.

3. Player 2, also known as "O," takes the next turn and enters their symbol (O) into a different empty box on the board.

4. Players continue taking turns alternately, filling empty boxes with their symbols until either:
   - One player successfully forms a line of their symbol (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, resulting in a win.
   - All the boxes on the board are filled without a winner, leading to a draw.

5. The game ends as soon as a win or draw condition is reached, and the final result is displayed on the screen.

*How the Game Works:*
1. The game starts with a welcome message and displays the empty 3x3 board on the screen.

2. Player 1 (X) is prompted to make the first move by choosing an available box on the board to place their symbol (X).

3. Player 2 (O) then takes their turn, choosing an available box to place their symbol (O).

4. The game continues with players taking turns until a win or draw condition is met.

5. After each player's turn, the board is updated and displayed on the screen.

6. When the game concludes, the final result is displayed, announcing the winner (if any) or declaring a draw.

*Code Description:*
This code is a simple and beginner-friendly implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. It provides a console-based interface that 
allows two players to play the game, taking turns to place their chosen symbols (X or O) on the 3x3 board. The code utilizes basic control
structures and loops to handle player inputs, update the board state, and check for win or drawÂ conditions.
