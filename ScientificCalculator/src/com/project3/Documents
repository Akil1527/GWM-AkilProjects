*Scientific Calculator - Intermediate Level*

This Java project is a comprehensive scientific calculator designed for intermediate-level programmers. The calculator provides a 
user-friendly interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced mathematical functions, including 
trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.

*Key Features:*
1. *User Interface:* The scientific calculator offers a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the calculator
easily. The interface includes buttons for different operations and functions, along with a display screen to show the input and output.

2. *Basic Arithmetic Operations:* Users can perform standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division using the calculator.

3. *Trigonometric Functions:* The calculator supports trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, tangent, as well as their inverse 
functions (arcsine, arccosine, arctangent).

4. *Logarithmic and Exponential Functions:* Users can calculate logarithms (log) and exponential (e^x) functions for any given input.

5. *Square Root and Power Functions:* The calculator allows users to find the square root and raise a number to a given power.

6. *Memory Functions:* Users can store and recall intermediate results using memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC).

*How the Calculator Works:*
1. The calculator starts by displaying the user interface with buttons for numbers, basic arithmetic operations, and various mathematical
functions.

2. Users can input numbers and perform standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using the numeric
and operation buttons.

3. Advanced mathematical functions like trigonometric functions, logarithms, square root, and exponential functions are available to the 
user through designated buttons.

4. The calculator handles complex calculations, respecting the order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS), ensuring accurate results for all
mathematical expressions.

5. Users can use memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC) to store and recall intermediate results, making it easier to perform complex 
calculations.

6. The calculator displays the input and the result on the screen, allowing users to review their calculations.

*Code Description:*
This code is an intermediate-level scientific calculator implemented in Java. It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a 
wide range of mathematical functions, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, square roots, and more.
The calculator follows the standard rules of mathematical calculations and ensures accurate results for allÂ expressions.
